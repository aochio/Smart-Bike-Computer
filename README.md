# Smart-Bike-Computer
## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to design a new bike computer that provides riders with real-time feedback. After
the rider input the wheel radius, they can access the speed, cadence, current gear ratio, and estimated wind
resistance while riding. At the same time, our product recommends to the rider the optimal gear ratio and
notifies the rider if the wind resistance increases. Our product consists of a 2.8'' LCD display controlled by
an Arduino Mega board, two hall effect sensors mounted to one of the chainstays, and two hot-wire
anemometers for measuring wind speed. While we were designing the LCD display, we found that the
current is critical to the proper functionality of the display. Thus, we add another feature to warn the rider
is the battery level is lower than the designed threshold.
